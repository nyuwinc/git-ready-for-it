### Configure tooling
You'll be configuring user information for all local repositories. The `$` means you'll run the commands on the command line. You should not include it. Run the following on your command line:
```
$ git config --global user.name "[your name]"
$ git config --global user.email "[email address]"
$ git config --global color.ui auto
```
- **What's going on???**
- Your name and email address are being recorded for any commits you make
- This way, you know the commits you made. The `color.ui auto` makes the output colorful.

# Step 1

### Create a repository
- Go to Github and click the `+` on the top right. It's the symbol next to your profile picture. Click `New repository`
- Under `Repository name`, give your repository a name! You can name your repository `Cool-Repo`, `ladiez-rock`, `IamAwesome`, `poop`, etc.
- Make sure `Initialize this repository with a README` is **UNCHECKED**
- `Add .gitignore` should say **None**
- `Add a license` should say **None**
- Click `Create repository`
- You might be greeted with a scary looking page, but don't worry! The next steps are coming up.
